# USDT-LAN-Wallet
A decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) digital wallet system for simulating USDT transactions over a local area network (LAN). This project demonstrates a lightweight blockchain-like protocol where nodes maintain distributed balance tables, execute transactions via UDP broadcasts, and enforce consensus through a simple majority confirmation mechanism.
